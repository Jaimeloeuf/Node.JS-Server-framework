	Example on how the framework will be used.
	The usage is quite similiar to the way express will be used.

	The framework will be exposing a single API via the 'fw' framework module,
	to allow the user/developer to define their own routes and define callback handlers.

	Perhaps for the handlers library. Add a prototype to the object so that all the handler
	functions have a prototype method called 'Protected'. So you can call
	CallBack.Protected(true)
	to set whether the route should be protected or not, in which if true there will be
	a automatic token verification process, where you will get back the token as part
	of the callback's arguements.

/*
	Think about how all these microservice will talk to each other?
		By HTTP requests? gRPC? PubSub?
			- See how can users of this framework implement gRPC communication with another instance of this framework
			  that belongs to a seperate 'micro service'
			- See how I can implement the Pub Sub model here, by allowing users to use both Redis and Kafka as pub sub
			- For my situation Kafka is better as it allows 'time-decoupled' event messaging.
		What about security for these communication protocols? What to do to prevent
		packet sniffers? Using smth to encrypt the connection like SSL/TLS?

	Is this microservicy thing fault tolerant?
		Meaning that if the service goes down what happerns?
		Does it mean that it is tolerant of one instant of a single service
		going down? Meaning that a cluster of emailing service will still be
		fine if one node goes down.

	To build out my own emailing microservice.
		- The email microservice will be in charge of storing the mailing list
		How to create an email with your own custom domain name?
		How to send a email with that custom domain based email?
		Add a feature/function where I can schedule when emails will be sent out.
