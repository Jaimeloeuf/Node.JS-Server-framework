/*	This function is just like the finalHandler in the Express world.

	@DOC Flow of logic in 'finalHandler':
	- Serialize res_body and store result in itself, a variable that is created on
	destructuring the 'ctx' object. Only the variable is changed, meaning the value
	in ctx.res_body called directly is unaffected/unchanged.
	- Set the content length in the response headers with the method from 'ctx' object.
	- Sent the response headers and status code back to the client
	- Sent the response payload back to client and close the connection.
	
	@TODO
	How do I serialize res_body and make it into a readable stream to pipe it into 'res' writable stream
	Maybe allow one more option in the handler to specify if they want the payload to be serialized
	
	Add some features for finalHandler to deal with the error(s) in 'ctx' object, if it is a client or there
	is client errors inside the error array of the ctx object, send it back to the client as part of the response
	message. Have a hashmap of predefined error messages in JSON format.
	Only send back the error to the client if the error is a 400 range client type of error.
	If the error is a 500 based server error, just send back the status code without any message body
	and log the errors in the error array without sending them to the user.
