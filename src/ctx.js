/* @Doc
	Copying koa.js idea on using a Ctx object
	Where Ctx is an object containing both the req and res objects and
	data parsed from the given 'req,res' objects.
	It exposes a easy to use and clean interface for letting data flow downstream in the
	request/response and middleware lifecycle, with many commonly used methods built in.
*/

// Dependencies
const url = require('url'); // Used to parse the url from the request object.

// Ctx class is used to create the 'ctx' object.
class Ctx {
	constructor(req, res) {
		this.req = req;
		this.res = res;

		/* Parsing data out from the request object */
		// Parsed url objects
		this.url = url.parse(req.url, true);
		// Get the path. Remove '/' from the start and the end, but keep those in the middle.
		this.path = this.url.pathname.replace(/^\/+|\/+$/g, '');
		// Get the request method, make all upper case for consistency
		this.method = req.method.toUpperCase();
		// Get headers as an object
		this.headers = req.headers;
		// Get the userAgent for route handlers to use
		this.userAgent = this.headers['user-agent'];
		// Get the contentType of the incoming req payload, to be used for parsing the payload
		this.contentType = this.headers["content-type"];
		// Method for comparing a given content type with the content type of the request object.
		this.checkContentType = (type) => type === this.contentType;
		// Get the query string as an object
		this.query = this.url.query;
		// Get the cookies in the headers  @TODO implement a method to deal with the cookies above.
		// cookies: getCookies(req.headers['cookie']),

		/* All things from the req object should be frozen after having their values set unlike the response objects */
		// Should the user and middleware be allowed to change the data parsed from the request object and stored in the ctx obj?

		/* Setting Defaults for response object */
		// Default must haves for the response headers, add more by defining new Key/Value pairs

			'cache-control': 'no-cache', // The default cache-control should be changed to suite the needs of prod env
			'X-Powered-By': 'Electricity and Wires', // Easter egg Joke to kinda confuse pen-testers :)
			'content-length': 0, // MUST be set by finalHandler else client will hang as it waits for the server

		// Method to push new error into the error array.

		// Technically the abv catch block will nvr happen as the value that is being written is always the same,
		// Thus in a sense the value is never redifined and thus no error will be thrown.

/* With this design, the code in the handler will execute finnish first before it enters finalHandler, and the finalHandler
	will then deal with this redirect. */
