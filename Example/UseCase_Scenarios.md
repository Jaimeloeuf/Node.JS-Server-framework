# Users API	(Users as in people who want to book services)
Users should be able to
1.	Have a home page that tells them all about their bookings and services that they book to. Like all
	the general informations.

2.	Users should be able to book new sessions for a specific service.

3.	Users should be able to update or delete a session for a specific service


For services,
UA can choose if,
Approval is needed for user to add a service to his/her list. E.g. tuition teacher only allows his/her students to book his/her services. However, as a saloon, you do not need to care, anyone can book a service.

But how do you fight spam booking if you allow anyone to book? Maybe set a book limit? So if the person book 3 times and all nvr turn up, then you can blacklist the user?
