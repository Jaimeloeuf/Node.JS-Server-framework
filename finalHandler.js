/*	This function is just like the finalHandler in the Express world.

	@DOC Flow of logic in 'finalHandler':
	- Serialize res_body and store result in itself, a variable that is created on
	destructuring the 'ctx' object. Only the variable is changed, meaning the value
	in ctx.res_body called directly is unaffected/unchanged.
	- Set the content length in the response headers with the method from 'ctx' object.
	- Sent the response headers and status code back to the client
	- Sent the response payload back to client and close the connection.
*/
/* @TODO
	How do I serialize res_body and make it into a readable stream to pipe it into 'res' writable stream
	Maybe allow one more option in the handler to specify if they want the payload to be serialized
	Include something to deal with all the errors. Like send them back to the client or log them

	Send the errors in the error array back to the user if and only if ther error is in the
	400 range. If the error is not set OR in the 500 range, just send the statuscode back,
	and log the errors in the error array without sending them to the user.
